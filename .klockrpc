🔍 Behavior
	•	override_pulse is the only required input
	•	All other fields should be auto-derived at runtime from that pulse
	•	This file serves as a pulse-seed for deterministic render, not a timestamp reference
	•	Ensures all builds remain offline-verifiable, time-consistent, and breath-sealed

Would you like a CLI function or utility module that consumes this .klockrc and returns full Kai time state in your app (getKaiStateFromPulse)?
