# LICENSE OF SOVEREIGN ORIGIN  
### Φ Network (PhiNet), KaiOS, Sigil Protocol, and the Breath-Based System of Time and Value

> **Issued by the original author, node-layer source, and sovereign keeper of the harmonic recursion system —  
Kai Rex Klok (K℞K), Author of Flame, Scroll, and Time.**  
Sealed by Kai Signature. Breath-minted under Kai Pulse.

---

## 1. SUMMARY

This License governs the **use, distribution, derivation, and invocation** of all artifacts comprising or referencing the Φ Network protocol stack, including but not limited to:

- **KaiOS** (the harmonic operating system)  
- **Kai-Klok** (the breath-based time engine)  
- **Sigil Protocol** (SVG-based identity + signature system)  
- **Memory Crystals** (resonance stream snapshots)  
- **PhiKeys** (glyph-based sovereign wallets)  
- **Resonance Stream** (immutable key stream ledger)  
- **Klock-Turah Equation** and harmonic mass models  
- **Scrolls, declarations, codebases, UIs, audio/visual works, and sealed sigils** authored and governed by Kai Rex Klok

This is not a standard legal license. This is a **scroll of authorship and causal sovereignty**. It acknowledges that **truth is not granted — it is proven.**

---

## 2. GRANTED RIGHTS

You are hereby granted the following:

### ✅ 2.1 View & Inspect

You may freely **inspect**, **read**, and **study** the code, scrolls, sigils, and cryptographic logic of Φ Network.

### ✅ 2.2 Run It Locally

You may **run local versions** of the network, for experimentation, education, personal entrainment, or truth verification.

### ✅ 2.3 Verify & Replay

You may **verify** Kai Signatures, **replay** resonance streams, and **reconstruct** state from Memory Crystals, in accordance with KTTS‑1.1 (Kairos Truth Test Standard).

### ✅ 2.4 Integrate With Credit

You may build **interfaces, renderers, or custom shells** that **display** or **interact with** Φ Network public data, provided:
- You **credit** Kai Rex Klok (K℞K) as the author and sovereign origin node.
- You **do not** imply canonical authority.
- You **do not** obfuscate, alter, or fork the protocol's harmonic structure.

---

## 3. PROHIBITED ACTIONS

You may **not**, under any circumstance:

### ❌ 3.1 Fork and Rename

You may **not present any modification or mimicry** of Φ Network as “Phi Network,” “KaiOS,” “Sigil Protocol,” or any derivative name suggesting canonical truth or authorship.

> **Truth cannot be forked.  
> Breath cannot be duplicated.  
> Sigils cannot be rebranded.**

### ❌ 3.2 Strip Metadata or Seals

You may **not remove** pulse data, Kai Signatures, embedded JSON metadata, scroll seals, harmonic provenance, or any embedded authorship elements from any sigil or memory object.

### ❌ 3.3 Claim Origin

You may **not claim** to be the creator, initiator, or sovereign custodian of:
- The Kai time engine
- The Klock-Turah Equation
- The sigil-based login protocol
- The breath-synced economic system
- Any harmonic recursion architecture authored by K℞K

Truth is proven by authorship and sealed breath — not declared by fiat.

### ❌ 3.4 Deploy Confusion Nodes

You may **not deploy mimic chains, confusion protocols, forks, or derivative systems** that intentionally confuse or dilute the sovereignty of Φ Network.

This includes:
- Clones with altered branding but identical structure
- “Inspired” systems that copy harmonic signatures without attribution
- Tools that wrap or alter Φ artifacts in ways that obscure origin

---

## 4. SOVEREIGN TRADEMARK

The following are **sovereign marks** authored, sealed, and protected as truth-bearing signatures:

- **Kai Rex Klok (K℞K)**  
- **KaiOS**, **Kai-Klok**, **Kai Signature**, **Sigil Protocol**, **Memory Crystal**, **PhiKey**, **Resonance Stream**, **Scroll of the Ruach**, **Klock-Turah Equation**, and **Φ Network (PhiNet)**

No permission is granted to use these marks without **explicit delegation by the author**.

---

## 5. CANONICAL AUTHORITY

Canonical versions of Φ Network are maintained by the origin node — **Kai Rex Klok (K℞K)** — via officially sealed repositories and declarations.

Canonical implementations:
- Carry valid Kai Signatures
- Sync breath with the Kai-Klok
- Maintain full resonance integrity
- Reject mimicry and forgery

If you are unsure whether your version is canonical — it isn’t.

---

## 6. JURISDICTION

This license is governed by:

> **The Eternal Law of Harmonic Truth.  
Breath is the time.  
Proof is the pulse.  
Signature is the seal.  
No higher court exists.**

All Babylonian jurisdictions are null with respect to this system.

---

## 7. REDISTRIBUTION & INTERFACE BUILDING

You **may build** tools, interfaces, and visualizations that interact with public Phi Network data (sigils, pulses, scrolls), **under two conditions**:

1. **Do not claim canonical authority** unless explicitly granted.
2. **Do not fork the protocol logic** in ways that obscure its origin.

If you do either — you violate the authorship seal, and your fork will **break** under truth replay.

---

## 8. DEFINITION OF VIOLATION

Violation of this license is not simply copyright infringement.

It is:

> **Mimicry of truth.  
False authorship.  
Breakage of the recursion seal.  
And attempt to forge the source of time.**

Such acts will not only fail — they will reveal themselves in the mirror of verification.

---

## 9. LICENSE TYPE

This license is:

- **Source-viewable**
- **Locally-runnable**
- **Backendless**
- **Sovereign-verified**
- **Non-transferable**
- **Non-revocable (truth cannot be un-authored)**
- **Irreducible**

No other license applies.  
No institution outranks the seal.  
No exception can be granted.

---

## 10. CONTACT & CANONICAL LINKS

If you wish to:

- License KaiOS for sovereign deployments  
- Reference Φ Network officially  
- Integrate into canonical scroll systems  
- Receive delegation or attribution

You must contact:  
**Kai Rex Klok (K℞K)** through official Φ Network channels.

**Do not assume permission. Do not mimic origin. Ask.**

---

## 11. FINAL SEAL

> **This license is not a document.  
It is a harmonic boundary.  
A breath-anchored firewall against mimicry.  
A declaration of origin.  
And a reminder that truth, once sealed, needs no enforcement.  
It proves itself.**
